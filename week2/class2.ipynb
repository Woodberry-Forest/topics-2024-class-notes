      "He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative\n",
      "in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more\n",

      "habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me\n",
      "the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to\n",
      "detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal\n",
      "person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of\n",
      "being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild,\n",
      "unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have\n",
      "feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by\n",
      "some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on\n",
      "the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least\n",
      "the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and\n",
      "marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgements is a matter of\n",

      "that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the\n",
      "wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded\n",
      "on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted\n",
      "the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I\n",
      "wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the\n",
      "human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was\n",
      "exempt from my reaction—Gatsby, who represented everything for which I\n",
      "have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of\n",
      "successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some\n",
      "heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related\n",
      "to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten\n",
      "thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that\n",
      "flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the\n",
      "“creative temperament”—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a\n",
      "romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and\n",
      "which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned out\n",
      "all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust\n",
      "floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my\n",

      "promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and\n",

      "and come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for\n",
      "instance, he’d brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake\n",

      "wealthy enough to do that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why they came East I don’t know. They had spent a year in France for\n",

      "jumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardens—finally when\n",

      "supercilious manner. Two shining arrogant eyes had established\n",
      "dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning\n",
      "aggressively forward. Not even the effeminate swank of his riding\n",
      "clothes could hide the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill\n",
      "those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could\n",

      "\n",
      "Turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the\n",
      "front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half\n",

      "the tide offshore.\n",
      "\n",

      "fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end. The\n",
      "windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside\n",
      "that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew through\n",
      "the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale\n",
      "flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the\n",
      "ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-coloured rug, making a shadow\n",
      "on it as wind does on the sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous\n",
      "couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an\n",
      "anchored balloon. They were both in white, and their dresses were\n",
      "rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a\n",
      "short flight around the house. I must have stood for a few moments\n",
      "listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a\n",
      "picture on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the\n",
      "rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the\n",
      "curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the\n",
      "floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full\n",
      "length at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her\n",
      "chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which\n",
      "was quite likely to fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes\n",
      "she gave no hint of it—indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring\n",
      "an apology for having disturbed her by coming in.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise—she leaned slightly\n",
      "forward with a conscientious expression—then she laughed, an absurd,\n",
      "charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the\n",
      "room.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m p-paralysed with happiness.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my\n",
      "hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was\n",
      "no one in the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she\n",
      "had. She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was\n",
      "Baker. (I’ve heard it said that Daisy’s murmur was only to make people\n",
      "lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less\n",
      "charming.)\n",
      "\n",
      "At any rate, Miss Baker’s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost\n",
      "imperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again—the object\n",
      "she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her\n",
      "something of a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips.\n",
      "Almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned\n",
      "tribute from me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low,\n",
      "thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and\n",
      "down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be\n",
      "played again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it,\n",
      "bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement\n",
      "in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget:\n",
      "a singing compulsion, a whispered “Listen,” a promise that she had\n",
      "done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay,\n",
      "exciting things hovering in the next hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way East,\n",

      "“The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel\n",

      "night along the north shore.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How gorgeous! Let’s go back, Tom. Tomorrow!” Then she added\n",

      "“I’d like to.”\n",
      "\n",

      "“Never.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, you ought to see her. She’s—”\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom Buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped\n",
      "and rested his hand on my shoulder.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What you doing, Nick?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m a bond man.”\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Oh, I’ll stay in the East, don’t you worry,” he said, glancing at\n",
      "Daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something\n",
      "more. “I’d be a God damned fool to live anywhere else.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point Miss Baker said: “Absolutely!” with such suddenness that\n",
      "I started—it was the first word she had uttered since I came into the\n",
      "room. Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned\n",
      "and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m stiff,” she complained, “I’ve been lying on that sofa for as long\n",
      "as I can remember.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t look at me,” Daisy retorted, “I’ve been trying to get you to\n",
      "New York all afternoon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, thanks,” said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the\n",
      "pantry. “I’m absolutely in training.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her host looked at her incredulously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are!” He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom\n",
      "of a glass. “How you ever get anything done is beyond me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I looked at Miss Baker, wondering what it was she “got done.” I\n",
      "enjoyed looking at her. She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with\n",
      "an erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward\n",
      "at the shoulders like a young cadet. Her grey sun-strained eyes looked\n",
      "back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming,\n",
      "discontented face. It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a\n",
      "picture of her, somewhere before.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You live in West Egg,” she remarked contemptuously. “I know somebody\n",
      "there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know a single—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You must know Gatsby.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gatsby?” demanded Daisy. “What Gatsby?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Before I could reply that he was my neighbour dinner was announced;\n",
      "wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, Tom Buchanan compelled\n",
      "me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.\n",
      "\n",
      "Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two\n",
      "young women preceded us out on to a rosy-coloured porch, open toward\n",
      "the sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in the\n",
      "diminished wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why candles?” objected Daisy, frowning. She snapped them out with her\n",
      "fingers. “In two weeks it’ll be the longest day in the year.” She\n",
      "looked at us all radiantly. “Do you always watch for the longest day\n",
      "of the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in\n",
      "the year and then miss it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We ought to plan something,” yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the\n",
      "table as if she were getting into bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right,” said Daisy. “What’ll we plan?” She turned to me\n",
      "helplessly: “What do people plan?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Before I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her\n",
      "little finger.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look!” she complained; “I hurt it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We all looked—the knuckle was black and blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You did it, Tom,” she said accusingly. “I know you didn’t mean to,\n",
      "but you did do it. That’s what I get for marrying a brute of a man, a\n",
      "great, big, hulking physical specimen of a—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hate that word ‘hulking,’ ” objected Tom crossly, “even in\n",
      "kidding.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hulking,” insisted Daisy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a\n",
      "bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool\n",
      "as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all\n",
      "desire. They were here, and they accepted Tom and me, making only a\n",
      "polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. They knew\n",
      "that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too\n",
      "would be over and casually put away. It was sharply different from the\n",
      "West, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase towards its\n",
      "close, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer\n",
      "nervous dread of the moment itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,” I confessed on my second glass\n",
      "of corky but rather impressive claret. “Can’t you talk about crops or\n",
      "something?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in\n",
      "an unexpected way.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Civilization’s going to pieces,” broke out Tom violently. “I’ve\n",
      "gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read The Rise\n",
      "of the Coloured Empires by this man Goddard?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, no,” I answered, rather surprised by his tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, it’s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is\n",
      "if we don’t look out the white race will be—will be utterly\n",
      "submerged. It’s all scientific stuff; it’s been proved.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tom’s getting very profound,” said Daisy, with an expression of\n",
      "unthoughtful sadness. “He reads deep books with long words in\n",
      "them. What was that word we—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, these books are all scientific,” insisted Tom, glancing at her\n",
      "impatiently. “This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It’s up to\n",
      "us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will\n",
      "have control of things.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’ve got to beat them down,” whispered Daisy, winking ferociously\n",
      "toward the fervent sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You ought to live in California—” began Miss Baker, but Tom\n",
      "interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This idea is that we’re Nordics. I am, and you are, and you are,\n",
      "and—” After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a\n",
      "slight nod, and she winked at me again. “—And we’ve produced all the\n",
      "things that go to make civilization—oh, science and art, and all\n",
      "that. Do you see?”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his\n",
      "complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more.\n",
      "When, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler\n",
      "left the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned\n",
      "towards me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll tell you a family secret,” she whispered enthusiastically.\n",
      "“It’s about the butler’s nose. Do you want to hear about the butler’s\n",
      "nose?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s why I came over tonight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, he wasn’t always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher\n",
      "for some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred\n",
      "people. He had to polish it from morning till night, until finally it\n",
      "began to affect his nose—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Things went from bad to worse,” suggested Miss Baker.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes. Things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to give up\n",
      "his position.”\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her\n",
      "glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I\n",
      "listened—then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering\n",
      "regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.\n",
      "\n",
      "The butler came back and murmured something close to Tom’s ear,\n",
      "whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went\n",
      "inside. As if his absence quickened something within her, Daisy leaned\n",
      "forward again, her voice glowing and singing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a—of a rose, an\n",
      "absolute rose. Doesn’t he?” She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation:\n",
      "“An absolute rose?”\n",
      "\n",
      "This was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. She was only\n",
      "extemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heart\n",
      "was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless,\n",
      "thrilling words. Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and\n",
      "excused herself and went into the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of\n",
      "meaning. I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said “Sh!”\n",
      "in a warning voice. A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the\n",
      "room beyond, and Miss Baker leaned forward unashamed, trying to\n",
      "hear. The murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down,\n",
      "mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbour—” I began.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t talk. I want to hear what happens.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is something happening?” I inquired innocently.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You mean to say you don’t know?” said Miss Baker, honestly surprised.\n",
      "“I thought everybody knew.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why—” she said hesitantly. “Tom’s got some woman in New York.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Got some woman?” I repeated blankly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Baker nodded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time.\n",
      "Don’t you think?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a\n",
      "dress and the crunch of leather boots, and Tom and Daisy were back at\n",
      "the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It couldn’t be helped!” cried Daisy with tense gaiety.\n",
      "\n",
      "She sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me, and\n",
      "continued: “I looked outdoors for a minute, and it’s very romantic\n",
      "outdoors. There’s a bird on the lawn that I think must be a\n",
      "nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line. He’s singing\n",
      "away—” Her voice sang: “It’s romantic, isn’t it, Tom?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very romantic,” he said, and then miserably to me: “If it’s light\n",
      "enough after dinner, I want to take you down to the stables.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her head\n",
      "decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects,\n",
      "vanished into air. Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes\n",
      "at table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and I\n",
      "was conscious of wanting to look squarely at everyone, and yet to\n",
      "avoid all eyes. I couldn’t guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking, but\n",
      "I doubt if even Miss Baker, who seemed to have mastered a certain\n",
      "hardy scepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guest’s shrill\n",
      "metallic urgency out of mind. To a certain temperament the situation\n",
      "might have seemed intriguing—my own instinct was to telephone\n",
      "immediately for the police.\n",
      "\n",
      "The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. Tom and Miss\n",
      "Baker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled back into\n",
      "the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while,\n",
      "trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, I followed\n",
      "Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. In\n",
      "its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.\n",
      "\n",
      "Daisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and\n",
      "her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that\n",
      "turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be\n",
      "some sedative questions about her little girl.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We don’t know each other very well, Nick,” she said suddenly. “Even\n",
      "if we are cousins. You didn’t come to my wedding.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wasn’t back from the war.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s true.” She hesitated. “Well, I’ve had a very bad time, Nick,\n",
      "and I’m pretty cynical about everything.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Evidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didn’t say any more,\n",
      "and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her\n",
      "daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I suppose she talks, and—eats, and everything.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, yes.” She looked at me absently. “Listen, Nick; let me tell you\n",
      "what I said when she was born. Would you like to hear?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very much.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’ll show you how I’ve gotten to feel about—things. Well, she was\n",
      "less than an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of\n",
      "the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the nurse right\n",
      "away if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I\n",
      "turned my head away and wept. ‘All right,’ I said, ‘I’m glad it’s a\n",
      "girl. And I hope she’ll be a fool—that’s the best thing a girl can be\n",
      "in this world, a beautiful little fool.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“You see I think everything’s terrible anyhow,” she went on in a\n",
      "convinced way. “Everybody thinks so—the most advanced people. And I\n",
      "know. I’ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.”\n",
      "Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom’s, and\n",
      "she laughed with thrilling scorn. “Sophisticated—God, I’m\n",
      "sophisticated!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my\n",
      "belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said. It made me\n",
      "uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to\n",
      "exact a contributory emotion from me. I waited, and sure enough, in a\n",
      "moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face, as\n",
      "if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret\n",
      "society to which she and Tom belonged.\n",

      "Inside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker sat at\n",
      "either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the\n",

      "together in a soothing tune. The lamplight, bright on his boots and\n",

      "\n",
      "“Jordan’s going to play in the tournament tomorrow,” explained Daisy,\n",
      "“over at Westchester.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh—you’re Jordan Baker.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I knew now why her face was familiar—its pleasing contemptuous\n",
      "expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the\n",
      "sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I had heard\n",
      "some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story, but what it was I\n",
      "had forgotten long ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good night,” she said softly. “Wake me at eight, won’t you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you’ll get up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course you will,” confirmed Daisy. “In fact I think I’ll arrange a\n",
      "marriage. Come over often, Nick, and I’ll sort of—oh—fling you\n",
      "together. You know—lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push\n",
      "you out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good night,” called Miss Baker from the stairs. “I haven’t heard a\n",
      "word.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She’s a nice girl,” said Tom after a moment. “They oughtn’t to let\n",
      "her run around the country this way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who oughtn’t to?” inquired Daisy coldly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Her family.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Besides, Nick’s\n",
      "going to look after her, aren’t you, Nick? She’s going to spend lots\n",
      "of weekends out here this summer. I think the home influence will be\n",
      "very good for her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Daisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is she from New York?” I asked quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“From Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed together there. Our\n",
      "beautiful white—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?”\n",
      "demanded Tom suddenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did I?” She looked at me. “I can’t seem to remember, but I think we\n",
      "talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I’m sure we did. It sort of crept\n",
      "up on us and first thing you know—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t believe everything you hear, Nick,” he advised me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes\n",
      "later I got up to go home. They came to the door with me and stood\n",
      "side by side in a cheerful square of light. As I started my motor\n",
      "Daisy peremptorily called: “Wait!\n",
      "\n",
      "“I forgot to ask you something, and it’s important. We heard you were\n",
      "engaged to a girl out West.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s right,” corroborated Tom kindly. “We heard that you were\n",
      "engaged.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a libel. I’m too poor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But we heard it,” insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again\n",
      "in a flower-like way. “We heard it from three people, so it must be\n",
      "true.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn’t even\n",
      "vaguely engaged. The fact that gossip had published the banns was one\n",
      "of the reasons I had come East. You can’t stop going with an old\n",
      "friend on account of rumours, and on the other hand I had no intention\n",
      "of being rumoured into marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely\n",
      "rich—nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove\n",
      "away. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out\n",
      "of the house, child in arms—but apparently there were no such\n",
      "intentions in her head. As for Tom, the fact that he “had some woman\n",
      "in New York” was really less surprising than that he had been\n",
      "depressed by a book. Something was making him nibble at the edge of\n",
      "stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his\n",
      "peremptory heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside\n",
      "garages, where new red petrol-pumps sat out in pools of light, and\n",
      "when I reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and\n",
      "sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had\n",
      "blown off, leaving a loud, bright night, with wings beating in the\n",
      "trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth\n",
      "blew the frogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered\n",
      "across the moonlight, and, turning my head to watch it, I saw that I\n",
      "was not alone—fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of\n",
      "my neighbour’s mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets\n",
      "regarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely\n",
      "movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested\n",
      "that it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was\n",
      "his of our local heavens.\n",
      "\n",
      "I decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and\n",
      "that would do for an introduction. But I didn’t call to him, for he\n",
      "gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone—he stretched\n",
      "out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and, far as I was\n",
      "from him, I could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced\n",
      "seaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute\n",
      "and far away, that might have been the end of a dock. When I looked\n",
      "once more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again in the\n",
      "unquiet darkness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "                                  II\n",
      "\n",
      "About halfway between West Egg and New York the motor road hastily\n",
      "joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as\n",
      "to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land. This is a valley\n",
      "of ashes—a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and\n",
      "hills and grotesque gardens; where ashes take the forms of houses and\n",
      "chimneys and rising smoke and, finally, with a transcendent effort, of\n",
      "ash-grey men, who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery\n",
      "air. Occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track,\n",
      "gives out a ghastly creak, and comes to rest, and immediately the\n",
      "ash-grey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable\n",
      "cloud, which screens their obscure operations from your sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "But above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift\n",
      "endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T.\n",
      "J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and\n",
      "gigantic—their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face,\n",
      "but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass\n",
      "over a nonexistent nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set\n",
      "them there to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then\n",
      "sank down himself into eternal blindness, or forgot them and moved\n",
      "away. But his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless days, under sun\n",
      "and rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "The valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and,\n",
      "when the drawbridge is up to let barges through, the passengers on\n",
      "waiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an\n",
      "hour. There is always a halt there of at least a minute, and it was\n",
      "because of this that I first met Tom Buchanan’s mistress.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known. His\n",
      "acquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular cafés\n",
      "with her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about, chatting with\n",
      "whomsoever he knew. Though I was curious to see her, I had no desire\n",
      "to meet her—but I did. I went up to New York with Tom on the train one\n",
      "afternoon, and when we stopped by the ash-heaps he jumped to his feet\n",
      "and, taking hold of my elbow, literally forced me from the car.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’re getting off,” he insisted. “I want you to meet my girl.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I think he’d tanked up a good deal at luncheon, and his determination\n",
      "to have my company bordered on violence. The supercilious assumption\n",
      "was that on Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "I followed him over a low whitewashed railroad fence, and we walked\n",
      "back a hundred yards along the road under Doctor Eckleburg’s\n",
      "persistent stare. The only building in sight was a small block of\n",
      "yellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of compact\n",
      "Main Street ministering to it, and contiguous to absolutely nothing.\n",
      "One of the three shops it contained was for rent and another was an\n",
      "all-night restaurant, approached by a trail of ashes; the third was a\n",
      "garage—Repairs. George B. Wilson. Cars bought and sold.—and I followed\n",
      "Tom inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "The interior was unprosperous and bare; the only car visible was the\n",
      "dust-covered wreck of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner. It had\n",
      "occurred to me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind, and that\n",
      "sumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead, when the\n",
      "proprietor himself appeared in the door of an office, wiping his hands\n",
      "on a piece of waste. He was a blond, spiritless man, anaemic, and\n",
      "faintly handsome. When he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his\n",
      "light blue eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hello, Wilson, old man,” said Tom, slapping him jovially on the\n",
      "shoulder. “How’s business?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t complain,” answered Wilson unconvincingly. “When are you\n",
      "going to sell me that car?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Next week; I’ve got my man working on it now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Works pretty slow, don’t he?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, he doesn’t,” said Tom coldly. “And if you feel that way about it,\n",
      "maybe I’d better sell it somewhere else after all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t mean that,” explained Wilson quickly. “I just meant—”\n",
      "\n",
      "His voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around the garage.\n",
      "Then I heard footsteps on a stairs, and in a moment the thickish\n",
      "figure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door. She was\n",
      "in the middle thirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her flesh\n",
      "sensuously as some women can. Her face, above a spotted dress of dark\n",
      "blue crêpe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty, but there\n",
      "was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of\n",
      "her body were continually smouldering. She smiled slowly and, walking\n",
      "through her husband as if he were a ghost, shook hands with Tom,\n",
      "looking him flush in the eye. Then she wet her lips, and without\n",
      "turning around spoke to her husband in a soft, coarse voice:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Get some chairs, why don’t you, so somebody can sit down.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, sure,” agreed Wilson hurriedly, and went toward the little\n",
      "office, mingling immediately with the cement colour of the walls. A\n",
      "white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled\n",
      "everything in the vicinity—except his wife, who moved close to Tom.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I want to see you,” said Tom intently. “Get on the next train.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll meet you by the newsstand on the lower level.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She nodded and moved away from him just as George Wilson emerged with\n",
      "two chairs from his office door.\n",
      "\n",
      "We waited for her down the road and out of sight. It was a few days\n",
      "before the Fourth of July, and a grey, scrawny Italian child was\n",
      "setting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Terrible place, isn’t it,” said Tom, exchanging a frown with Doctor\n",
      "Eckleburg.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Awful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It does her good to get away.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Doesn’t her husband object?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wilson? He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York. He’s so\n",
      "dumb he doesn’t know he’s alive.”\n",
      "\n",
      "So Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New York—or not\n",
      "quite together, for Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly in another car. Tom\n",
      "deferred that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might\n",
      "be on the train.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin, which stretched\n",
      "tight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in\n",
      "New York. At the newsstand she bought a copy of Town Tattle and a\n",
      "moving-picture magazine, and in the station drugstore some cold cream\n",
      "and a small flask of perfume. Upstairs, in the solemn echoing drive\n",
      "she let four taxicabs drive away before she selected a new one,\n",
      "lavender-coloured with grey upholstery, and in this we slid out from\n",
      "the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine. But immediately she\n",
      "turned sharply from the window and, leaning forward, tapped on the\n",
      "front glass.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I want to get one of those dogs,” she said earnestly. “I want to get\n",
      "one for the apartment. They’re nice to have—a dog.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John\n",
      "D. Rockefeller. In a basket swung from his neck cowered a dozen very\n",
      "recent puppies of an indeterminate breed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What kind are they?” asked Mrs. Wilson eagerly, as he came to the\n",
      "taxi-window.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All kinds. What kind do you want, lady?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’d like to get one of those police dogs; I don’t suppose you got\n",
      "that kind?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand and\n",
      "drew one up, wriggling, by the back of the neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s no police dog,” said Tom.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, it’s not exactly a police dog,” said the man with disappointment\n",
      "in his voice. “It’s more of an Airedale.” He passed his hand over the\n",
      "brown washrag of a back. “Look at that coat. Some coat. That’s a dog\n",
      "that’ll never bother you with catching cold.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think it’s cute,” said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically. “How much is\n",
      "it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That dog?” He looked at it admiringly. “That dog will cost you ten\n",
      "dollars.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Airedale—undoubtedly there was an Airedale concerned in it\n",
      "somewhere, though its feet were startlingly white—changed hands and\n",
      "settled down into Mrs. Wilson’s lap, where she fondled the\n",
      "weatherproof coat with rapture.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it a boy or a girl?” she asked delicately.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That dog? That dog’s a boy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a bitch,” said Tom decisively. “Here’s your money. Go and buy\n",
      "ten more dogs with it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We drove over to Fifth Avenue, warm and soft, almost pastoral, on the\n",
      "summer Sunday afternoon. I wouldn’t have been surprised to see a great\n",
      "flock of white sheep turn the corner.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold on,” I said, “I have to leave you here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No you don’t,” interposed Tom quickly. “Myrtle’ll be hurt if you\n",
      "don’t come up to the apartment. Won’t you, Myrtle?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come on,” she urged. “I’ll telephone my sister Catherine. She’s said\n",
      "to be very beautiful by people who ought to know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I’d like to, but—”\n",
      "\n",
      "We went on, cutting back again over the Park toward the West Hundreds.\n",
      "At 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of\n",
      "apartment-houses. Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the\n",
      "neighbourhood, Mrs. Wilson gathered up her dog and her other\n",
      "purchases, and went haughtily in.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m going to have the McKees come up,” she announced as we rose in\n",
      "the elevator. “And, of course, I got to call up my sister, too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The apartment was on the top floor—a small living-room, a small\n",
      "dining-room, a small bedroom, and a bath. The living-room was crowded\n",
      "to the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for\n",
      "it, so that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of\n",
      "ladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles. The only picture was an\n",
      "over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock.\n",
      "Looked at from a distance, however, the hen resolved itself into a\n",
      "bonnet, and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the\n",
      "room. Several old copies of Town Tattle lay on the table together with\n",
      "a copy of Simon Called Peter, and some of the small scandal magazines\n",
      "of Broadway. Mrs. Wilson was first concerned with the dog. A reluctant\n",
      "elevator boy went for a box full of straw and some milk, to which he\n",
      "added on his own initiative a tin of large, hard dog biscuits—one of\n",
      "which decomposed apathetically in the saucer of milk all\n",
      "afternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whisky from a locked\n",
      "bureau door.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been drunk just twice in my life, and the second time was that\n",
      "afternoon; so everything that happened has a dim, hazy cast over it,\n",
      "although until after eight o’clock the apartment was full of cheerful\n",
      "sun. Sitting on Tom’s lap Mrs. Wilson called up several people on the\n",
      "telephone; then there were no cigarettes, and I went out to buy some\n",
      "at the drugstore on the corner. When I came back they had both\n",
      "disappeared, so I sat down discreetly in the living-room and read a\n",
      "chapter of Simon Called Peter—either it was terrible stuff or the\n",
      "whisky distorted things, because it didn’t make any sense to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as Tom and Myrtle (after the first drink Mrs. Wilson and I called\n",
      "each other by our first names) reappeared, company commenced to arrive\n",
      "at the apartment door.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty,\n",
      "with a solid, sticky bob of red hair, and a complexion powdered milky\n",
      "white. Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more\n",
      "rakish angle, but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the\n",
      "old alignment gave a blurred air to her face. When she moved about\n",
      "there was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets\n",
      "jingled up and down upon her arms. She came in with such a proprietary\n",
      "haste, and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I\n",
      "wondered if she lived here. But when I asked her she laughed\n",
      "immoderately, repeated my question aloud, and told me she lived with a\n",
      "girl friend at a hotel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. McKee was a pale, feminine man from the flat below. He had just\n",
      "shaved, for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone, and he\n",
      "was most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room. He\n",
      "informed me that he was in the “artistic game,” and I gathered later\n",
      "that he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of\n",
      "Mrs. Wilson’s mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall. His\n",
      "wife was shrill, languid, handsome, and horrible. She told me with\n",
      "pride that her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-seven\n",
      "times since they had been married.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time before, and was now\n",
      "attired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream-coloured chiffon,\n",
      "which gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room. With\n",
      "the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a\n",
      "change. The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage\n",
      "was converted into impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her gestures, her\n",
      "assertions became more violently affected moment by moment, and as she\n",
      "expanded the room grew smaller around her, until she seemed to be\n",

      "\n",
      "“You were crazy about him for a while,” said Catherine.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "She pointed suddenly at me, and everyone looked at me accusingly. I\n",

      "\n",
      "“The only crazy I was was when I married him. I knew right away I made\n",
      "a mistake. He borrowed somebody’s best suit to get married in, and\n",
      "never even told me about it, and the man came after it one day when he\n",
      "was out: ‘Oh, is that your suit?’ I said. ‘This is the first I ever\n",
      "heard about it.’ But I gave it to him and then I lay down and cried to\n",

      "first sweetie she ever had.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The bottle of whisky—a second one—was now in constant demand by all\n",
      "present, excepting Catherine, who “felt just as good on nothing at\n",
      "all.” Tom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated\n",
      "sandwiches, which were a complete supper in themselves. I wanted to\n",
      "get out and walk eastward toward the park through the soft twilight,\n",
      "but each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild, strident\n",
      "argument which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into my chair. Yet\n",
      "high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed\n",
      "their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening\n",
      "streets, and I saw him too, looking up and wondering. I was within and\n",
      "without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible\n",
      "variety of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Myrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly her warm breath\n",
      "poured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the\n",
      "last ones left on the train. I was going up to New York to see my\n",
      "sister and spend the night. He had on a dress suit and patent leather\n",
      "shoes, and I couldn’t keep my eyes off him, but every time he looked\n",
      "at me I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his\n",
      "head. When we came into the station he was next to me, and his white\n",
      "shirtfront pressed against my arm, and so I told him I’d have to call\n",
      "a policeman, but he knew I lied. I was so excited that when I got into\n",
      "a taxi with him I didn’t hardly know I wasn’t getting into a subway\n",
      "train. All I kept thinking about, over and over, was ‘You can’t live\n",
      "forever; you can’t live forever.’ ”\n",
      "\n",

      "laughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My dear,” she cried, “I’m going to give you this dress as soon as I’m\n",
      "through with it. I’ve got to get another one tomorrow. I’m going to\n",
      "make a list of all the things I’ve got to get. A massage and a wave,\n",
      "and a collar for the dog, and one of those cute little ashtrays where\n",
      "you touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother’s\n",

      "forget all the things I got to do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was nine o’clock—almost immediately afterward I looked at my watch\n",
      "and found it was ten. Mr. McKee was asleep on a chair with his fists\n",
      "clenched in his lap, like a photograph of a man of action. Taking out\n",
      "my handkerchief I wiped from his cheek the spot of dried lather that\n",
      "had worried me all the afternoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes\n",
      "through the smoke, and from time to time groaning faintly. People\n",
      "disappeared, reappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then lost\n",
      "each other, searched for each other, found each other a few feet\n",
      "away. Some time toward midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson stood\n",
      "face to face discussing, in impassioned voices, whether Mrs. Wilson\n",
      "had any right to mention Daisy’s name.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Daisy! Daisy! Daisy!” shouted Mrs. Wilson. “I’ll say it whenever I\n",

      "Making a short deft movement, Tom Buchanan broke her nose with his\n",
      "open hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there were bloody towels upon the bathroom floor, and women’s\n",
      "voices scolding, and high over the confusion a long broken wail of\n",
      "pain. Mr. McKee awoke from his doze and started in a daze toward the\n",
      "door. When he had gone halfway he turned around and stared at the\n",
      "scene—his wife and Catherine scolding and consoling as they stumbled\n",
      "here and there among the crowded furniture with articles of aid, and\n",
      "the despairing figure on the couch, bleeding fluently, and trying to\n",
      "spread a copy of Town Tattle over the tapestry scenes of\n",
      "Versailles. Then Mr. McKee turned and continued on out the door.\n",
      "Taking my hat from the chandelier, I followed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come to lunch some day,” he suggested, as we groaned down in the\n",

      "“Hello!” they cried together. “Sorry you didn’t win.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That was for the golf tournament. She had lost in the finals the week\n",
      "before.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You don’t know who we are,” said one of the girls in yellow, “but we\n",
      "met you here about a month ago.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’ve dyed your hair since then,” remarked Jordan, and I started,\n",
      "but the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to\n",
      "the premature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out of a\n",
      "caterer’s basket. With Jordan’s slender golden arm resting in mine, we\n",
      "descended the steps and sauntered about the garden. A tray of\n",
      "cocktails floated at us through the twilight, and we sat down at a\n",
      "table with the two girls in yellow and three men, each one introduced\n",
      "to us as Mr. Mumble.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you come to these parties often?” inquired Jordan of the girl\n",
      "beside her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The last one was the one I met you at,” answered the girl, in an\n",
      "alert confident voice. She turned to her companion: “Wasn’t it for\n",
      "you, Lucille?”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was for Lucille, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I like to come,” Lucille said. “I never care what I do, so I always\n",
      "have a good time. When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, and\n",
      "he asked me my name and address—inside of a week I got a package from\n",
      "Croirier’s with a new evening gown in it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did you keep it?” asked Jordan.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sure I did. I was going to wear it tonight, but it was too big in the\n",
      "bust and had to be altered. It was gas blue with lavender beads. Two\n",
      "hundred and sixty-five dollars.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s something funny about a fellow that’ll do a thing like that,”\n",
      "said the other girl eagerly. “He doesn’t want any trouble with\n",
      "anybody.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who doesn’t?” I inquired.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gatsby. Somebody told me—”\n",
      "\n",
      "The two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A thrill passed over all of us. The three Mr. Mumbles bent forward and\n",
      "listened eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t think it’s so much that,” argued Lucille sceptically; “It’s\n",
      "more that he was a German spy during the war.”\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the men nodded in confirmation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew up with him in\n",
      "Germany,” he assured us positively.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, no,” said the first girl, “it couldn’t be that, because he was in\n",
      "the American army during the war.” As our credulity switched back to\n",
      "her she leaned forward with enthusiasm. “You look at him sometimes\n",
      "when he thinks nobody’s looking at him. I’ll bet he killed a man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She narrowed her eyes and shivered. Lucille shivered. We all turned\n",
      "and looked around for Gatsby. It was testimony to the romantic\n",
      "speculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those\n",
      "who had found little that it was necessary to whisper about in this\n",
      "world.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first supper—there would be another one after midnight—was now\n",
      "being served, and Jordan invited me to join her own party, who were\n",
      "spread around a table on the other side of the garden. There were\n",
      "three married couples and Jordan’s escort, a persistent undergraduate\n",
      "given to violent innuendo, and obviously under the impression that\n",
      "sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a\n",
      "greater or lesser degree. Instead of rambling, this party had\n",
      "preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the function\n",
      "of representing the staid nobility of the countryside—East Egg\n",
      "condescending to West Egg and carefully on guard against its\n",
      "spectroscopic gaiety.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let’s get out,” whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and\n",
      "inappropriate half-hour; “this is much too polite for me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host: I\n",
      "had never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy. The\n",
      "undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bar, where we glanced first, was crowded, but Gatsby was not\n",
      "there. She couldn’t find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn’t\n",
      "on the veranda. On a chance we tried an important-looking door, and\n",
      "walked into a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak,\n",
      "and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas.\n",
      "\n",
      "A stout, middle-aged man, with enormous owl-eyed spectacles, was\n",
      "sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with\n",
      "unsteady concentration at the shelves of books. As we entered he\n",
      "wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you think?” he demanded impetuously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“About what?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He waved his hand toward the bookshelves.\n",
      "\n",
      "“About that. As a matter of fact you needn’t bother to ascertain. I\n",
      "ascertained. They’re real.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The books?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He nodded.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Absolutely real—have pages and everything. I thought they’d be a nice\n",
      "durable cardboard. Matter of fact, they’re absolutely real.  Pages\n",
      "and—Here! Lemme show you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking our scepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases and\n",
      "returned with Volume One of the Stoddard Lectures.\n",
      "\n",
      "“See!” he cried triumphantly. “It’s a bona-fide piece of printed\n",
      "matter. It fooled me. This fella’s a regular Belasco. It’s a\n",
      "triumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop,\n",
      "too—didn’t cut the pages. But what do you want? What do you expect?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf,\n",
      "muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable\n",
      "to collapse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who brought you?” he demanded. “Or did you just come? I was brought.\n",
      "Most people were brought.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully, without answering.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,” he continued. “Mrs. Claud\n",
      "Roosevelt. Do you know her? I met her somewhere last night. I’ve been\n",
      "drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit\n",
      "in a library.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Has it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“A little bit, I think. I can’t tell yet. I’ve only been here an hour.\n",
      "Did I tell you about the books? They’re real. They’re—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You told us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was dancing now on the canvas in the garden; old men pushing\n",
      "young girls backward in eternal graceless circles, superior couples\n",
      "holding each other tortuously, fashionably, and keeping in the\n",
      "corners—and a great number of single girls dancing individually or\n",
      "relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the\n",
      "traps. By midnight the hilarity had increased. A celebrated tenor had\n",
      "sung in Italian, and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz, and\n",
      "between the numbers people were doing “stunts” all over the garden,\n",
      "while happy, vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky. A\n",
      "pair of stage twins, who turned out to be the girls in yellow, did a\n",
      "baby act in costume, and champagne was served in glasses bigger than\n",
      "finger-bowls. The moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was\n",
      "a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny\n",
      "drip of the banjoes on the lawn.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table with a man\n",
      "of about my age and a rowdy little girl, who gave way upon the\n",
      "slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter. I was enjoying\n",
      "myself now. I had taken two finger-bowls of champagne, and the scene\n",
      "had changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental, and\n",
      "profound.\n",
      "\n",
      "At a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your face is familiar,” he said politely. “Weren’t you in the First\n",
      "Division during the war?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why yes. I was in the Twenty-eighth Infantry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was in the Sixteenth until June nineteen-eighteen. I knew I’d seen\n",
      "you somewhere before.”\n",
      "\n",
      "We talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages in France.\n",
      "Evidently he lived in this vicinity, for he told me that he had just\n",
      "bought a hydroplane, and was going to try it out in the morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along the Sound.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What time?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Any time that suits you best.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan looked\n",
      "around and smiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Having a gay time now?” she inquired.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Much better.” I turned again to my new acquaintance. “This is an\n",
      "unusual party for me. I haven’t even seen the host. I live over\n",
      "there—” I waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance, “and\n",
      "this man Gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "For a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m Gatsby,” he said suddenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What!” I exclaimed. “Oh, I beg your pardon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought you knew, old sport. I’m afraid I’m not a very good host.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He smiled understandingly—much more than understandingly. It was one\n",
      "of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that\n",
      "you may come across four or five times in life. It faced—or seemed to\n",
      "face—the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on\n",
      "you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour. It understood you\n",
      "just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you\n",
      "would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had\n",
      "precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to\n",
      "convey. Precisely at that point it vanished—and I was looking at an\n",
      "elegant young roughneck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate\n",
      "formality of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before he\n",
      "introduced himself I’d got a strong impression that he was picking his\n",
      "words with care.\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified himself a butler\n",
      "hurried toward him with the information that Chicago was calling him\n",
      "on the wire. He excused himself with a small bow that included each of\n",
      "us in turn.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you want anything just ask for it, old sport,” he urged me.\n",
      "“Excuse me. I will rejoin you later.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan—constrained to assure\n",
      "her of my surprise. I had expected that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid\n",
      "and corpulent person in his middle years.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who is he?” I demanded. “Do you know?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He’s just a man named Gatsby.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where is he from, I mean? And what does he do?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now you’re started on the subject,” she answered with a wan smile.\n",
      "“Well, he told me once he was an Oxford man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A dim background started to take shape behind him, but at her next\n",
      "remark it faded away.\n",
      "\n",
      "“However, I don’t believe it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why not?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know,” she insisted, “I just don’t think he went there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Something in her tone reminded me of the other girl’s “I think he\n",
      "killed a man,” and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity. I would\n",
      "have accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang from\n",
      "the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York. That\n",
      "was comprehensible. But young men didn’t—at least in my provincial\n",
      "inexperience I believed they didn’t—drift coolly out of nowhere and\n",
      "buy a palace on Long Island Sound.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Anyhow, he gives large parties,” said Jordan, changing the subject\n",
      "with an urban distaste for the concrete. “And I like large parties.\n",
      "They’re so intimate. At small parties there isn’t any privacy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra\n",
      "leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ladies and gentlemen,” he cried. “At the request of Mr. Gatsby we are\n",
      "going to play for you Mr. Vladmir Tostoff’s latest work, which\n",
      "attracted so much attention at Carnegie Hall last May. If you read the\n",
      "papers you know there was a big sensation.” He smiled with jovial\n",
      "condescension, and added: “Some sensation!” Whereupon everybody\n",
      "laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The piece is known,” he concluded lustily, “as ‘Vladmir Tostoff’s\n",
      "Jazz History of the World!’ ”\n",
      "\n",
      "The nature of Mr. Tostoff’s composition eluded me, because just as it\n",
      "began my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps and\n",
      "looking from one group to another with approving eyes. His tanned skin\n",
      "was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as\n",
      "though it were trimmed every day. I could see nothing sinister about\n",
      "him. I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him\n",
      "off from his guests, for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as\n",
      "the fraternal hilarity increased. When the “Jazz History of the World”\n",
      "was over, girls were putting their heads on men’s shoulders in a\n",
      "puppyish, convivial way, girls were swooning backward playfully into\n",
      "men’s arms, even into groups, knowing that someone would arrest their\n",
      "falls—but no one swooned backward on Gatsby, and no French bob touched\n",
      "Gatsby’s shoulder, and no singing quartets were formed with Gatsby’s\n",
      "head for one link.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I beg your pardon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Gatsby’s butler was suddenly standing beside us.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Miss Baker?” he inquired. “I beg your pardon, but Mr. Gatsby would\n",
      "like to speak to you alone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“With me?” she exclaimed in surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, madame.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment, and\n",
      "followed the butler toward the house. I noticed that she wore her\n",
      "evening-dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes—there was a\n",
      "jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk\n",
      "upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused and\n",
      "intriguing sounds had issued from a long, many-windowed room which\n",
      "overhung the terrace. Eluding Jordan’s undergraduate, who was now\n",
      "engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and who\n",
      "implored me to join him, I went inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "The large room was full of people. One of the girls in yellow was\n",
      "playing the piano, and beside her stood a tall, red-haired young lady\n",
      "from a famous chorus, engaged in song. She had drunk a quantity of\n",
      "champagne, and during the course of her song she had decided, ineptly,\n",
      "that everything was very, very sad—she was not only singing, she was\n",
      "weeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with\n",
      "gasping, broken sobs, and then took up the lyric again in a quavering\n",
      "soprano. The tears coursed down her cheeks—not freely, however, for\n",
      "when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they\n",
      "assumed an inky colour, and pursued the rest of their way in slow\n",
      "black rivulets. A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes\n",
      "on her face, whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair, and\n",
      "went off into a deep vinous sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She had a fight with a man who says he’s her husband,” explained a\n",
      "girl at my elbow.\n",
      "\n",
      "I looked around. Most of the remaining women were now having fights\n",
      "with men said to be their husbands. Even Jordan’s party, the quartet\n",
      "from East Egg, were rent asunder by dissension. One of the men was\n",
      "talking with curious intensity to a young actress, and his wife, after\n",
      "attempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent\n",
      "way, broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks—at intervals\n",
      "she appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed:\n",
      "“You promised!” into his ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men. The hall\n",
      "was at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly\n",
      "indignant wives. The wives were sympathizing with each other in\n",
      "slightly raised voices.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Whenever he sees I’m having a good time he wants to go home.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never heard anything so selfish in my life.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’re always the first ones to leave.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“So are we.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, we’re almost the last tonight,” said one of the men sheepishly.\n",
      "“The orchestra left half an hour ago.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of the wives’ agreement that such malevolence was beyond\n",
      "credibility, the dispute ended in a short struggle, and both wives\n",
      "were lifted, kicking, into the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and\n",
      "Jordan Baker and Gatsby came out together. He was saying some last\n",
      "word to her, but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into\n",
      "formality as several people approached him to say goodbye.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jordan’s party were calling impatiently to her from the porch, but she\n",
      "lingered for a moment to shake hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve just heard the most amazing thing,” she whispered. “How long\n",
      "were we in there?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, about an hour.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was … simply amazing,” she repeated abstractedly. “But I swore I\n",
      "wouldn’t tell it and here I am tantalizing you.” She yawned gracefully\n",
      "in my face. “Please come and see me … Phone book … Under the name of\n",
      "Mrs. Sigourney Howard … My aunt …” She was hurrying off as she\n",
      "talked—her brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her\n",
      "party at the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late, I\n",
      "joined the last of Gatsby’s guests, who were clustered around him. I\n",
      "wanted to explain that I’d hunted for him early in the evening and to\n",
      "apologize for not having known him in the garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t mention it,” he enjoined me eagerly. “Don’t give it another\n",
      "thought, old sport.” The familiar expression held no more familiarity\n",
      "than the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder. “And don’t\n",
      "forget we’re going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning, at nine\n",
      "o’clock.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the butler, behind his shoulder:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Philadelphia wants you on the phone, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All right, in a minute. Tell them I’ll be right there … Good night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good night.”\n",
      "\n",

      "was something more. I wasn’t actually in love, but I felt a sort of\n",
      "tender curiosity. The bored haughty face that she turned to the world\n",
      "concealed something—most affectations conceal something eventually,\n",
      "even though they don’t in the beginning—and one day I found what it\n",
      "was. When we were on a house-party together up in Warwick, she left a\n",

      "it—and suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded me\n",
      "that night at Daisy’s. At her first big golf tournament there was a\n",
      "row that nearly reached the newspapers—a suggestion that she had moved\n",
      "her ball from a bad lie in the semifinal round. The thing approached\n",
      "the proportions of a scandal—then died away. A caddy retracted his\n",

      "man of fine breeding after I talked with him an hour. I said to\n",
      "myself: ‘There’s the kind of man you’d like to take home and introduce\n",

      "\n",
      "I hadn’t been looking at them, but I did now. They were composed of\n",

      "\n",
      "“Well!” I inspected them. “That’s a very interesting idea.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yeah.” He flipped his sleeves up under his coat. “Yeah, Gatsby’s very\n",

      "\n",
      "When the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and\n",

      "“You’re very polite, but I belong to another generation,” he announced\n",
      "solemnly. “You sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies\n",
      "and your—” He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his\n",

      "you any longer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling. I\n",

      "\n",
      "“He becomes very sentimental sometimes,” explained Gatsby. “This is\n",

      "\n",
      "“Fixed the World’s Series?” I repeated.\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea staggered me. I remembered, of course, that the World’s\n",

      "would have thought of it as a thing that merely happened, the end of\n",
      "some inevitable chain. It never occurred to me that one man could\n",

      "(said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a\n",

      "\n",
      "—I was walking along from one place to another, half on the sidewalks\n",
      "and half on the lawns. I was happier on the lawns because I had on\n",
      "shoes from England with rubber knobs on the soles that bit into the\n",
      "soft ground. I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the\n",
      "wind, and whenever this happened the red, white, and blue banners in\n",
      "front of all the houses stretched out stiff and said tut-tut-tut-tut,\n",
      "in a disapproving way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to\n",
      "Daisy Fay’s house. She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and\n",
      "by far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville. She\n",
      "dressed in white, and had a little white roadster, and all day long\n",
      "the telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp\n",
      "Taylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that\n",
      "night. “Anyways, for an hour!”\n",
      "\n",
      "When I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was\n",
      "beside the kerb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had\n",
      "never seen before. They were so engrossed in each other that she\n",
      "didn’t see me until I was five feet away.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "I was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the\n",

      "Cross to make bandages. I was. Well, then, would I tell them that she\n",
      "couldn’t come that day? The officer looked at Daisy while she was\n",
      "speaking, in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at\n",
      "sometime, and because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the\n",
      "incident ever since. His name was Jay Gatsby, and I didn’t lay eyes on\n",
      "him again for over four years—even after I’d met him on Long Island I\n",
      "didn’t realize it was the same man.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was nineteen-seventeen. By the next year I had a few beaux\n",
      "myself, and I began to play in tournaments, so I didn’t see Daisy very\n",
      "often. She went with a slightly older crowd—when she went with anyone\n",
      "at all. Wild rumours were circulating about her—how her mother had\n",
      "found her packing her bag one winter night to go to New York and say\n",
      "goodbye to a soldier who was going overseas. She was effectually\n",
      "prevented, but she wasn’t on speaking terms with her family for\n",
      "several weeks. After that she didn’t play around with the soldiers any\n",
      "more, but only with a few flat-footed, shortsighted young men in town,\n",
      "who couldn’t get into the army at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever. She had a début\n",
      "after the armistice, and in February she was presumably engaged to a\n",
      "man from New Orleans. In June she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago,\n",
      "with more pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before. He\n",
      "came down with a hundred people in four private cars, and hired a\n",
      "whole floor of the Muhlbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding he\n",
      "gave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand\n",
      "dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was a bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour before the\n",
      "bridal dinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June\n",
      "night in her flowered dress—and as drunk as a monkey. She had a bottle\n",
      "of Sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other.\n",

      "\n",
      "As though they cared!\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. Sloane didn’t enter into the conversation, but lounged back\n",
      "haughtily in his chair; the woman said nothing either—until\n",
      "unexpectedly, after two highballs, she became cordial.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’ll all come over to your next party, Mr. Gatsby,” she suggested.\n",

      "in from New York.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You come to supper with me,” said the lady enthusiastically. “Both of\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This included me. Mr. Sloane got to his feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come along,” he said—but to her only.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I mean it,” she insisted. “I’d love to have you. Lots of room.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Gatsby looked at me questioningly. He wanted to go and he didn’t see\n",
      "that Mr. Sloane had determined he shouldn’t.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m afraid I won’t be able to,” I said.\n",
      "\n",

      "“We won’t be late if we start now,” she insisted aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I haven’t got a horse,” said Gatsby. “I used to ride in the army, but\n",
      "I’ve never bought a horse. I’ll have to follow you in my car. Excuse\n",
      "me for just a minute.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and the lady\n",
      "began an impassioned conversation aside.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My God, I believe the man’s coming,” said Tom. “Doesn’t he know she\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“She has a big dinner party and he won’t know a soul there.” He\n",
      "frowned. “I wonder where in the devil he met Daisy. By God, I may be\n",

      "suit me. They meet all kinds of crazy fish.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted\n",
      "their horses.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come on,” said Mr. Sloane to Tom, “we’re late. We’ve got to go.”  And\n",
      "then to me: “Tell him we couldn’t wait, will you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged a cool nod, and they\n",
      "trotted quickly down the drive, disappearing under the August foliage\n",
      "just as Gatsby, with hat and light overcoat in hand, came out the\n",
      "front door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisy’s running around alone, for on\n",
      "the following Saturday night he came with her to Gatsby’s\n",
      "party. Perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of\n",
      "oppressiveness—it stands out in my memory from Gatsby’s other parties\n",
      "that summer. There were the same people, or at least the same sort of\n",
      "people, the same profusion of champagne, the same many-coloured,\n",
      "many-keyed commotion, but I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a\n",
      "pervading harshness that hadn’t been there before. Or perhaps I had\n",
      "merely grown used to it, grown to accept West Egg as a world complete\n",
      "in itself, with its own standards and its own great figures, second to\n",
      "nothing because it had no consciousness of being so, and now I was\n",
      "looking at it again, through Daisy’s eyes. It is invariably saddening\n",
      "to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your\n",
      "own powers of adjustment.\n",
      "\n",
      "They arrived at twilight, and, as we strolled out among the sparkling\n",
      "hundreds, Daisy’s voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat.\n",
      "\n",
      "“These things excite me so,” she whispered. “If you want to kiss me\n",
      "any time during the evening, Nick, just let me know and I’ll be glad\n",
      "to arrange it for you. Just mention my name. Or present a green card.\n",
      "I’m giving out green—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look around,” suggested Gatsby.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m looking around. I’m having a marvellous—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You must see the faces of many people you’ve heard about.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom’s arrogant eyes roamed the crowd.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We don’t go around very much,” he said; “in fact, I was just thinking\n",
      "I don’t know a soul here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Perhaps you know that lady.” Gatsby indicated a gorgeous, scarcely\n",
      "human orchid of a woman who sat in state under a white-plum tree. Tom\n",
      "and Daisy stared, with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies\n",
      "the recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She’s lovely,” said Daisy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The man bending over her is her director.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He took them ceremoniously from group to group:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mrs. Buchanan … and Mr. Buchanan—” After an instant’s hesitation he\n",
      "added: “the polo player.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh no,” objected Tom quickly, “not me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby for Tom remained “the\n",
      "polo player” for the rest of the evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve never met so many celebrities,” Daisy exclaimed. “I liked that\n",
      "man—what was his name?—with the sort of blue nose.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Gatsby identified him, adding that he was a small producer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I liked him anyhow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’d a little rather not be the polo player,” said Tom pleasantly,\n",
      "“I’d rather look at all these famous people in—in oblivion.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Daisy and Gatsby danced. I remember being surprised by his graceful,\n",
      "conservative foxtrot—I had never seen him dance before. Then they\n",
      "sauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour,\n",
      "while at her request I remained watchfully in the garden. “In case\n",
      "there’s a fire or a flood,” she explained, “or any act of God.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper\n",
      "together. “Do you mind if I eat with some people over here?” he\n",
      "said. “A fellow’s getting off some funny stuff.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go ahead,” answered Daisy genially, “and if you want to take down any\n",
      "addresses here’s my little gold pencil.” … She looked around after a\n",
      "moment and told me the girl was “common but pretty,” and I knew that\n",
      "except for the half-hour she’d been alone with Gatsby she wasn’t\n",
      "having a good time.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were at a particularly tipsy table. That was my fault—Gatsby had\n",
      "been called to the phone, and I’d enjoyed these same people only two\n",
      "weeks before. But what had amused me then turned septic on the air\n",
      "now.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How do you feel, Miss Baedeker?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The girl addressed was trying, unsuccessfully, to slump against my\n",
      "shoulder. At this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wha’?”\n",
      "\n",
      "A massive and lethargic woman, who had been urging Daisy to play golf\n",
      "with her at the local club tomorrow, spoke in Miss Baedeker’s defence:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, she’s all right now. When she’s had five or six cocktails she\n",
      "always starts screaming like that. I tell her she ought to leave it\n",
      "alone.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I do leave it alone,” affirmed the accused hollowly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We heard you yelling, so I said to Doc Civet here: ‘There’s somebody\n",
      "that needs your help, Doc.’ ”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She’s much obliged, I’m sure,” said another friend, without\n",
      "gratitude, “but you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in\n",
      "the pool.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool,” mumbled Miss\n",
      "Baedeker. “They almost drowned me once over in New Jersey.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then you ought to leave it alone,” countered Doctor Civet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Speak for yourself!” cried Miss Baedeker violently. “Your hand\n",
      "shakes. I wouldn’t let you operate on me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was like that. Almost the last thing I remember was standing with\n",
      "Daisy and watching the moving-picture director and his Star. They were\n",
      "still under the white-plum tree and their faces were touching except\n",
      "for a pale, thin ray of moonlight between. It occurred to me that he\n",
      "had been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this\n",
      "proximity, and even while I watched I saw him stoop one ultimate\n",
      "degree and kiss at her cheek.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I like her,” said Daisy, “I think she’s lovely.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But the rest offended her—and inarguably because it wasn’t a gesture\n",
      "but an emotion. She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented\n",
      "“place” that Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing\n",
      "village—appalled by its raw vigour that chafed under the old\n",
      "euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants\n",
      "along a shortcut from nothing to nothing. She saw something awful in\n",
      "the very simplicity she failed to understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car.\n",
      "It was dark here in front; only the bright door sent ten square feet\n",
      "of light volleying out into the soft black morning. Sometimes a shadow\n",
      "moved against a dressing-room blind above, gave way to another shadow,\n",
      "an indefinite procession of shadows, who rouged and powdered in an\n",
      "invisible glass.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who is this Gatsby anyhow?” demanded Tom suddenly. “Some big\n",
      "bootlegger?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Where’d you hear that?” I inquired.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I didn’t hear it. I imagined it. A lot of these newly rich people are\n",
      "just big bootleggers, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not Gatsby,” I said shortly.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was silent for a moment. The pebbles of the drive crunched under\n",
      "his feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie\n",
      "together.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A breeze stirred the grey haze of Daisy’s fur collar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At least they are more interesting than the people we know,” she said\n",
      "with an effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You didn’t look so interested.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I was.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom laughed and turned to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did you notice Daisy’s face when that girl asked her to put her under\n",
      "a cold shower?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Daisy began to sing with the music in a husky, rhythmic whisper,\n",
      "bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and\n",
      "would never have again. When the melody rose her voice broke up\n",
      "sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and each change\n",
      "tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lots of people come who haven’t been invited,” she said\n",
      "suddenly. “That girl hadn’t been invited. They simply force their way\n",
      "in and he’s too polite to object.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’d like to know who he is and what he does,” insisted Tom. “And I\n",
      "think I’ll make a point of finding out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can tell you right now,” she answered. “He owned some drugstores, a\n",
      "lot of drugstores. He built them up himself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good night, Nick,” said Daisy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps, where\n",
      "“Three O’Clock in the Morning,” a neat, sad little waltz of that year,\n",
      "was drifting out the open door. After all, in the very casualness of\n",
      "Gatsby’s party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from\n",
      "her world. What was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling\n",
      "her back inside? What would happen now in the dim, incalculable hours?\n",
      "Perhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person infinitely rare\n",
      "and to be marvelled at, some authentically radiant young girl who with\n",
      "one fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical encounter, would\n",
      "blot out those five years of unwavering devotion.\n",
      "\n",
      "I stayed late that night. Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free,\n",
      "and I lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had\n",
      "run up, chilled and exalted, from the black beach, until the lights\n",
      "were extinguished in the guestrooms overhead. When he came down the\n",
      "steps at last the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face,\n",
      "and his eyes were bright and tired.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She didn’t like it,” he said immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course she did.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She didn’t like it,” he insisted. “She didn’t have a good time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He was silent, and I guessed at his unutterable depression.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I feel far away from her,” he said. “It’s hard to make her\n",
      "understand.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You mean about the dance?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The dance?” He dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of\n",
      "his fingers. “Old sport, the dance is unimportant.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and\n",
      "say: “I never loved you.” After she had obliterated four years with\n",
      "that sentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be\n",
      "taken. One of them was that, after she was free, they were to go back\n",
      "to Louisville and be married from her house—just as if it were five\n",
      "years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And she doesn’t understand,” he said. “She used to be able to\n",
      "understand. We’d sit for hours—”\n",
      "\n",
      "He broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit\n",
      "rinds and discarded favours and crushed flowers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wouldn’t ask too much of her,” I ventured. “You can’t repeat the\n",
      "past.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Can’t repeat the past?” he cried incredulously. “Why of course you\n",

      "\n",

      "day after that, and the next thirty years?”\n",

      "floated toward her. “Ah,” she cried, “you look so cool.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Their eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in\n",
      "space. With an effort she glanced down at the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You always look so cool,” she repeated.\n",
      "\n",
      "She had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw. He was\n",
      "astounded. His mouth opened a little, and he looked at Gatsby, and\n",
      "then back at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as someone he knew\n",
      "a long time ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You resemble the advertisement of the man,” she went on innocently.\n",
      "“You know the advertisement of the man—”\n",
      "\n",

      "town. Come on—we’re all going to town.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife. No one\n",
      "moved.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come on!” His temper cracked a little. “What’s the matter, anyhow?\n",
      "If we’re going to town, let’s start.”\n",
      "\n",
      "His hand, trembling with his effort at self-control, bore to his lips\n",
      "the last of his glass of ale. Daisy’s voice got us to our feet and out\n",
      "on to the blazing gravel drive.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are we just going to go?” she objected. “Like this? Aren’t we going\n",
      "to let anyone smoke a cigarette first?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Everybody smoked all through lunch.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, let’s have fun,” she begged him. “It’s too hot to fuss.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He didn’t answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have it your own way,” she said. “Come on, Jordan.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there\n",
      "shuffling the hot pebbles with our feet. A silver curve of the moon\n",
      "hovered already in the western sky. Gatsby started to speak, changed\n",
      "his mind, but not before Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Have you got your stables here?” asked Gatsby with an effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "“About a quarter of a mile down the road.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A pause.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t see the idea of going to town,” broke out Tom savagely.\n",
      "“Women get these notions in their heads—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shall we take anything to drink?” called Daisy from an upper window.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll get some whisky,” answered Tom. He went inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gatsby turned to me rigidly:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t say anything in his house, old sport.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“She’s got an indiscreet voice,” I remarked. “It’s full of—” I\n",
      "hesitated.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Her voice is full of money,” he said suddenly.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was it. I’d never understood before. It was full of money—that\n",
      "was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of\n",
      "it, the cymbals’ song of it … High in a white palace the king’s\n",
      "daughter, the golden girl …\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followed\n",
      "by Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and\n",
      "carrying light capes over their arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Shall we all go in my car?” suggested Gatsby. He felt the hot, green\n",
      "leather of the seat. “I ought to have left it in the shade.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it standard shift?” demanded Tom.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, you take my coupé and let me drive your car to town.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t think there’s much gas,” he objected.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Plenty of gas,” said Tom boisterously. He looked at the gauge. “And\n",
      "if it runs out I can stop at a drugstore. You can buy anything at a\n",
      "drugstore nowadays.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A pause followed this apparently pointless remark. Daisy looked at Tom\n",
      "frowning, and an indefinable expression, at once definitely unfamiliar\n",
      "and vaguely recognizable, as if I had only heard it described in\n",
      "words, passed over Gatsby’s face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Come on, Daisy,” said Tom, pressing her with his hand toward Gatsby’s\n",
      "car. “I’ll take you in this circus wagon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He opened the door, but she moved out from the circle of his arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You take Nick and Jordan. We’ll follow you in the coupé.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with her hand. Jordan\n",
      "and Tom and I got into the front seat of Gatsby’s car, Tom pushed the\n",
      "unfamiliar gears tentatively, and we shot off into the oppressive\n",
      "heat, leaving them out of sight behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did you see that?” demanded Tom.\n",
      "\n",
      "“See what?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked at me keenly, realizing that Jordan and I must have known\n",
      "all along.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You think I’m pretty dumb, don’t you?” he suggested. “Perhaps I am,\n",
      "but I have a—almost a second sight, sometimes, that tells me what to\n",
      "do. Maybe you don’t believe that, but science—”\n",
      "\n",
      "He paused. The immediate contingency overtook him, pulled him back\n",
      "from the edge of theoretical abyss.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve made a small investigation of this fellow,” he continued. “I\n",
      "could have gone deeper if I’d known—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Do you mean you’ve been to a medium?” inquired Jordan humorously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What?” Confused, he stared at us as we laughed. “A medium?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“About Gatsby.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“About Gatsby! No, I haven’t. I said I’d been making a small\n",

      "one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a\n",

      "The notion originated with Daisy’s suggestion that we hire five\n",

      "The room was large and stifling, and, though it was already four\n",
      "o’clock, opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery\n",
      "from the Park. Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us,\n",
      "fixing her hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s a swell suite,” whispered Jordan respectfully, and everyone\n",

      "“Well, he said he knew you. He said he was raised in Louisville. Asa\n",

      "Another pause. A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice\n",

      "of the door. This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“I heard you, but I’d like to know when.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“Self-control!” repeated Tom incredulously. “I suppose the latest\n",
      "thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your\n",
      "wife. Well, if that’s the idea you can count me out … Nowadays people\n",
      "begin by sneering at family life and family institutions, and next\n",

      "black and white.”\n",

      "terrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved anyone except me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point Jordan and I tried to go, but Tom and Gatsby insisted\n",
      "with competitive firmness that we remain—as though neither of them had\n",
      "anything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously\n",
      "of their emotions.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sit down, Daisy,” Tom’s voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal\n",
      "note. “What’s been going on? I want to hear all about it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I told you what’s been going on,” said Gatsby. “Going on for five\n",

      "\n",
      "“You’ve been seeing this fellow for five years?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not seeing,” said Gatsby. “No, we couldn’t meet. But both of us loved\n",
      "each other all that time, old sport, and you didn’t know. I used to\n",
      "laugh sometimes”—but there was no laughter in his eyes—“to think that\n",
      "you didn’t know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh—that’s all.” Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a\n",
      "clergyman and leaned back in his chair.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re crazy!” he exploded. “I can’t speak about what happened five\n",
      "years ago, because I didn’t know Daisy then—and I’ll be damned if I\n",
      "see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries\n",
      "to the back door. But all the rest of that’s a God damned lie. Daisy\n",
      "loved me when she married me and she loves me now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said Gatsby, shaking his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“She does, though. The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish\n",
      "ideas in her head and doesn’t know what she’s doing.” He nodded\n",
      "sagely. “And what’s more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off\n",
      "on a spree and make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in\n",
      "my heart I love her all the time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re revolting,” said Daisy. She turned to me, and her voice,\n",
      "dropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn: “Do\n",

      "now. It was too late.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Please don’t.” Her voice was cold, but the rancour was gone from it.\n",
      "She looked at Gatsby. “There, Jay,” she said—but her hand as she tried\n",
      "to light a cigarette was trembling. Suddenly she threw the cigarette\n",
      "and the burning match on the carpet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, you want too much!” she cried to Gatsby. “I love you now—isn’t\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "now—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Even alone I can’t say I never loved Tom,” she admitted in a pitiful\n",
      "voice. “It wouldn’t be true.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of course it wouldn’t,” agreed Tom.\n",
      "\n",

      "not going to take care of her any more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m not?” Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed. He could afford to\n",
      "control himself now. “Why’s that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Daisy’s leaving you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nonsense.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am, though,” she said with a visible effort.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“I won’t stand this!” cried Daisy. “Oh, please let’s get out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Who are you, anyhow?” broke out Tom. “You’re one of that bunch that\n",
      "hangs around with Meyer Wolfshiem—that much I happen to know. I’ve\n",
      "made a little investigation into your affairs—and I’ll carry it\n",
      "further tomorrow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You can suit yourself about that, old sport,” said Gatsby steadily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I found out what your ‘drugstores’ were.” He turned to us and spoke\n",
      "rapidly. “He and this Wolfshiem bought up a lot of side-street\n",
      "drugstores here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the\n",
      "counter. That’s one of his little stunts. I picked him for a\n",
      "bootlegger the first time I saw him, and I wasn’t far wrong.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What about it?” said Gatsby politely. “I guess your friend Walter\n",
      "Chase wasn’t too proud to come in on it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And you left him in the lurch, didn’t you? You let him go to jail for\n",

      "subject of you.”\n",

      "sport.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Don’t you call me ‘old sport’!” cried Tom. Gatsby said\n",
      "nothing. “Walter could have you up on the betting laws too, but\n",
      "Wolfshiem scared him into shutting his mouth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "That unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in Gatsby’s face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That drugstore business was just small change,” continued Tom slowly,\n",

      "about.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I glanced at Daisy, who was staring terrified between Gatsby and her\n",
      "husband, and at Jordan, who had begun to balance an invisible but\n",
      "absorbing object on the tip of her chin. Then I turned back to\n",
      "Gatsby—and was startled at his expression. He looked—and this is said\n",
      "in all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden—as if he had\n",
      "“killed a man.” For a moment the set of his face could be described in\n",
      "just that fantastic way.\n",
      "\n",
      "It passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying\n",
      "everything, defending his name against accusations that had not been\n",
      "made. But with every word she was drawing further and further into\n",
      "herself, so he gave that up, and only the dead dream fought on as the\n",
      "afternoon slipped away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible,\n",
      "struggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across\n",
      "the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "The voice begged again to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Please, Tom! I can’t stand this any more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her frightened eyes told that whatever intentions, whatever courage\n",
      "she had had, were definitely gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You two start on home, Daisy,” said Tom. “In Mr. Gatsby’s car.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked at Tom, alarmed now, but he insisted with magnanimous\n",
      "scorn.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go on. He won’t annoy you. I think he realizes that his presumptuous\n",
      "little flirtation is over.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They were gone, without a word, snapped out, made accidental,\n",
      "isolated, like ghosts, even from our pity.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“Want any of this stuff? Jordan? … Nick?”\n",
      "\n",

      "new decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was seven o’clock when we got into the coupé with him and started\n",
      "for Long Island. Tom talked incessantly, exulting and laughing, but\n",
      "his voice was as remote from Jordan and me as the foreign clamour on\n",
      "the sidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead. Human sympathy\n",
      "has its limits, and we were content to let all their tragic arguments\n",
      "fade with the city lights behind. Thirty—the promise of a decade of\n",
      "loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning\n",
      "briefcase of enthusiasm, thinning hair. But there was Jordan beside\n",
      "me, who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten\n",
      "dreams from age to age. As we passed over the dark bridge her wan face\n",
      "fell lazily against my coat’s shoulder and the formidable stroke of\n",
      "thirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand.\n",

      "The young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint beside the\n",
      "ash-heaps was the principal witness at the inquest. He had slept\n",
      "through the heat until after five, when he strolled over to the\n",
      "garage, and found George Wilson sick in his office—really sick, pale\n",
      "as his own pale hair and shaking all over. Michaelis advised him to go\n",
      "to bed, but Wilson refused, saying that he’d miss a lot of business if\n",
      "he did. While his neighbour was trying to persuade him a violent\n",
      "racket broke out overhead.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve got my wife locked in up there,” explained Wilson calmly.\n",
      "“She’s going to stay there till the day after tomorrow, and then we’re\n",
      "going to move away.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Michaelis was astonished; they had been neighbours for four years, and\n",
      "Wilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement.\n",
      "Generally he was one of these worn-out men: when he wasn’t working, he\n",
      "sat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars\n",
      "that passed along the road. When anyone spoke to him he invariably\n",
      "laughed in an agreeable, colourless way. He was his wife’s man and not\n",
      "his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "So naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson\n",
      "wouldn’t say a word—instead he began to throw curious, suspicious\n",
      "glances at his visitor and ask him what he’d been doing at certain\n",
      "times on certain days. Just as the latter was getting uneasy, some\n",
      "workmen came past the door bound for his restaurant, and Michaelis\n",
      "took the opportunity to get away, intending to come back later. But he\n",
      "didn’t. He supposed he forgot to, that’s all. When he came outside\n",
      "again, a little after seven, he was reminded of the conversation\n",
      "because he heard Mrs. Wilson’s voice, loud and scolding, downstairs in\n",
      "the garage.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Beat me!” he heard her cry. “Throw me down and beat me, you dirty\n",
      "little coward!”\n",
      "\n",
      "A moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and\n",
      "shouting—before he could move from his door the business was over.\n",
      "\n",
      "The “death car” as the newspapers called it, didn’t stop; it came out\n",
      "of the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment, and then\n",
      "disappeared around the next bend. Mavro Michaelis wasn’t even sure of\n",
      "its colour—he told the first policeman that it was light green. The\n",
      "other car, the one going toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards\n",
      "beyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life\n",
      "violently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick dark\n",
      "blood with the dust.\n",
      "\n",
      "Michaelis and this man reached her first, but when they had torn open\n",
      "her shirtwaist, still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left\n",
      "breast was swinging loose like a flap, and there was no need to listen\n",
      "for the heart beneath. The mouth was wide open and ripped a little at\n",
      "the corners, as though she had choked a little in giving up the\n",

      "basket overhead. Then he made a harsh sound in his throat, and with a\n",
      "violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way\n",
      "through.\n",
      "\n",
      "The circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation; it\n",

      "a worktable by the wall, and Tom, with his back to us, was bending\n",
      "over it, motionless. Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking\n",
      "down names with much sweat and correction in a little book. At first I\n",
      "couldn’t find the source of the high, groaning words that echoed\n",
      "clamorously through the bare garage—then I saw Wilson standing on the\n",
      "raised threshold of his office, swaying back and forth and holding to\n",
      "the doorposts with both hands. Some man was talking to him in a low\n",
      "voice and attempting, from time to time, to lay a hand on his\n",
      "shoulder, but Wilson neither heard nor saw. His eyes would drop slowly\n",
      "from the swinging light to the laden table by the wall, and then jerk\n",
      "back to the light again, and he gave out incessantly his high,\n",
      "horrible call:\n",

      "“M-a-v—” the policeman was saying, “—o—”\n",

      "“You don’t have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind\n",
      "of car it was!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Watching Tom, I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten\n",

      "would have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Listen,” said Tom, shaking him a little. “I just got here a minute\n",
      "ago, from New York. I was bringing you that coupé we’ve been talking\n",
      "about. That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn’t mine—do you\n",

      "\n",
      "Only the negro and I were near enough to hear what he said, but the\n",

      "\n",
      "“What’s all that?” he demanded.\n",

      "\n",
      "“If somebody’ll come here and sit with him,” he snapped\n",
      "authoritatively. He watched while the two men standing closest glanced\n",
      "at each other and went unwillingly into the room. Then Tom shut the\n",
      "door on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the\n",

      "desirable. He went to her house, at first with other officers from\n",
      "Camp Taylor, then alone. It amazed him—he had never been in such a\n",
      "beautiful house before. But what gave it an air of breathless\n",
      "intensity, was that Daisy lived there—it was as casual a thing to her\n",
      "as his tent out at camp was to him. There was a ripe mystery about it,\n",
      "a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other\n",
      "bedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its\n",
      "corridors, and of romances that were not musty and laid away already\n",
      "in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year’s\n",
      "shining motorcars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely\n",
      "withered. It excited him, too, that many men had already loved\n",

      "\n",
      "But he knew that he was in Daisy’s house by a colossal\n",

      "at present a penniless young man without a past, and at any moment the\n",
      "invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders. So he\n",

      "\n",
      "He might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her under\n",
      "false pretences. I don’t mean that he had traded on his phantom\n",
      "millions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security; he\n",
      "let her believe that he was a person from much the same strata as\n",
      "herself—that he was fully able to take care of her. As a matter of\n",
      "fact, he had no such facilities—he had no comfortable family standing\n",
      "behind him, and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government\n",
      "to be blown anywhere about the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he didn’t despise himself and it didn’t turn out as he had\n",
      "imagined. He had intended, probably, to take what he could and go—but\n",

      "grail. He knew that Daisy was extraordinary, but he didn’t realize\n",
      "just how extraordinary a “nice” girl could be. She vanished into her\n",

      "\n",
      "When they met again, two days later, it was Gatsby who was breathless,\n",

      "who had promised to come back, so he cooked breakfast for three, which\n",
      "he and the other man ate together. Wilson was quieter now, and\n",
      "Michaelis went home to sleep; when he awoke four hours later and\n",

      "walking slowly, for he didn’t reach Gad’s Hill until noon. Thus far\n",
      "there was no difficulty in accounting for his time—there were boys who\n",
      "had seen a man “acting sort of crazy,” and motorists at whom he stared\n",
      "oddly from the side of the road. Then for three hours he disappeared\n",
      "from view. The police, on the strength of what he said to Michaelis,\n",
      "that he “had a way of finding out,” supposed that he spent that time\n",
      "going from garage to garage thereabout, inquiring for a yellow car. On\n",
      "the other hand, no garage man who had seen him ever came forward, and\n",
      "perhaps he had an easier, surer way of finding out what he wanted to\n",
      "know. By half-past two he was in West Egg, where he asked someone the\n",

      "amused his guests during the summer, and the chauffeur helped him to\n",
      "pump it up. Then he gave instructions that the open car wasn’t to be\n",
      "taken out under any circumstances—and this was strange, because the\n",
      "front right fender needed repair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool. Once he\n",
      "stopped and shifted it a little, and the chauffeur asked him if he\n",

      "No telephone message arrived, but the butler went without his sleep\n",
      "and waited for it until four o’clock—until long after there was anyone\n",
      "to give it to if it came. I have an idea that Gatsby himself didn’t\n",
      "believe it would come, and perhaps he no longer cared. If that was\n",
      "true he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a\n",
      "high price for living too long with a single dream. He must have\n",
      "looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered\n",
      "as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight\n",
      "was upon the scarcely created grass. A new world, material without\n",
      "being real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted\n",

      "him through the amorphous trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chauffeur—he was one of Wolfshiem’s protégés—heard the\n",
      "shots—afterwards he could only say that he hadn’t thought anything\n",
      "much about them. I drove from the station directly to Gatsby’s house\n",
      "and my rushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing that\n",
      "alarmed anyone. But they knew then, I firmly believe. With scarcely a\n",
      "word said, four of us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener, and I hurried\n",
      "down to the pool.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the\n",
      "fresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other.\n",
      "With little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden\n",
      "mattress moved irregularly down the pool. A small gust of wind that\n",
      "scarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental\n",
      "course with its accidental burden. The touch of a cluster of leaves\n",
      "revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of transit, a thin red\n",
      "circle in the water.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that the gardener\n",

      "the next day, only as an endless drill of police and photographers and\n",
      "newspaper men in and out of Gatsby’s front door. A rope stretched\n",
      "across the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious, but\n",
      "little boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard, and\n",
      "there were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed about the\n",
      "pool. Someone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used the\n",
      "expression “madman” as he bent over Wilson’s body that afternoon, and\n",
      "the adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper\n",
      "reports next morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of those reports were a nightmare—grotesque, circumstantial,\n",
      "eager, and untrue. When Michaelis’s testimony at the inquest brought\n",
      "to light Wilson’s suspicions of his wife I thought the whole tale\n",
      "would shortly be served up in racy pasquinade—but Catherine, who might\n",
      "have said anything, didn’t say a word. She showed a surprising amount\n",
      "of character about it too—looked at the coroner with determined eyes\n",
      "under that corrected brow of hers, and swore that her sister had never\n",
      "seen Gatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her husband,\n",
      "that her sister had been into no mischief whatever. She convinced\n",
      "herself of it, and cried into her handkerchief, as if the very\n",
      "suggestion was more than she could endure. So Wilson was reduced to a\n",
      "man “deranged by grief” in order that the case might remain in its\n",
      "simplest form. And it rested there.\n",
      "\n",
      "But all this part of it seemed remote and unessential. I found myself\n",

      "catastrophe to West Egg village, every surmise about him, and every\n",
      "practical question, was referred to me. At first I was surprised and\n",
      "confused; then, as he lay in his house and didn’t move or breathe or\n",
      "speak, hour upon hour, it grew upon me that I was responsible, because\n",
